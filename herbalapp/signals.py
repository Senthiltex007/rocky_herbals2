# ✅ All old signals disabled for NEW MLM ENGINE
# ----------------------------------------------------------
# The new binary engine + sponsor engine uses explicit runners.
# Old auto-triggers (parent, package, left_child, right_child, etc.)
# are removed from the Member model and must NOT run anymore.
#
# This file is intentionally kept minimal to avoid crashes.
